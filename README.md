# Energy_Pricing_Models
EDA using energy markets data (price processes and return distribution)

EDA_Energy.Rmd focuses on price processes commonly used for energy markets, 
including fitting a Garch(1,1) model to the returns and fitting copula models. 

Rnw files use LaTeX syntax and includes a section on R code basics
demonstrated in the price modeling.

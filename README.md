# Energy_Pricing_Models
EDA using energy markets data (price processes and return distribution)

EDA_Energy.Rnw focuses on price processes commonly used for energy markets, 
including fitting a Garch(1,1) model to the returns. EDA_Energy_test.Rnw digresses
into the LaTeX syntax used in both files and includes a section on R code basics
used in this price modeling.
